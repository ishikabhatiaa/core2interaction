                <p>In a few weeks my brother's brithday was coming up and I decided to bake a cake for him.</p>
                <p>Seeing the direction of my obsession, I decided to make a box made cake</p>

                <p>Tiny me unsupervsied in a kitchen... oh lord</p>
                <p>In my head baking a cake online and in real life was exactly as easy</p>
                <p>That's when things went downhill...</p>
                <p>When the electric blender was working its magic I decided to add milk while it was on and the milk
                    just splatered everywhere</p>
                <p>To top it off I even managed to burn the now "liquid cake" when I popped it in the oven</p>

                <p> From that day I decided that I'd much rather stick to baking in the game. Hahaha</p>
                <p>And now after growing up, I leave it to the bakery to create the magic </p>

    <h1>Questionnaire</h1>

    <h3>1. DESCRIBE YOUR PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES WITH CODING. WHAT CLASSES HAVE YOU ALREADY TAKEN WHERE YOU WERE EXPOSED TO HTML/CSS/JS? WHAT PARTS OF THE CLASS RESONATED WITH YOU? WHAT PARTS WERE MOST CONFUSING?</h3>
    <p>Last semester was my first time coding. I really was very confused last class and didn’t understand a single thing, I was coding to just code if that makes sense.</p>

    <h3>2. HOW EXCITED ABOUT LEARNING CODE ARE YOU? ARE YOU NERVOUS ABOUT LEARNING CODE? IF SO, WHY? WHAT CAN I DO IN THIS CLASS TO HELP REDUCE THIS ANXIETY?</h3>
    <p>I get so stressed when I have to sit to code just because last semester I was coding without understanding any of it, so I feel like this semester is learning from the very beginning. I think you’re already doing a really good job explaining, and I think going around the class to see how everyone has done it helps too!</p>

    <h3>3. HOW DO YOU IMAGINE CODING FITTING IN WITH THE REST OF YOUR DESIGN CURRICULUM AND CAREER AFTER COLLEGE?</h3>
    <p>I think coding will fit in pretty well with the magazine digital world, which is what I hope to enter.</p>

    <h3>4. WHAT TEXT EDITOR DO YOU PREFER TO USE?</h3>
    <p>Google Docs and notes</p>

    <h3>5. HAVE YOU USED GITHUB BEFORE? DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS? DESCRIBE YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF GITHUB.</h3>
    <p>I have used GitHub before for my last website. It's like a virtual workspace where people collaborate on projects. It's a platform for storing and managing code. A place where multiple people can work on the same project, making changes, tracking those changes, and easily sharing their work with others. It helps in organizing and version-controlling code, making teamwork more efficient in software development.</p>

    <h3>6. DESCRIBE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT. TRY USING A UNIQUE ANALOGY TO DESCRIBE THIS RELATIONSHIP. BONUS POINTS FOR CREATIVE ANALOGIES.</h3>
    <p>HTML sets up the structure (skeleton), CSS adds the style (appearance), and JavaScript provides interactivity (movement) – like a website construction crew working together.</p>

    <h3>7. USING EACH HTML HEADING TAG, LIST YOUR FAVORITE FOODS RANKED BY IMPORTANCE.</h3>

    <h2>pasta</h2>
    <p>Something I can eat 24/7.</p>

    <h3>tiramisu</h3>
    <p>Never gets old, Sweet indulgence.</p>

    <h4>dosa</h4>
    <p>Comfort food.</p>

    <h5>tacos</h5>
    <p>A perfect treat.</p>

    <h6>salads</h6>
    <p>For a healthier option.</p>

    <h3>8. CREATE AN UNORDERED LIST AND LINK TO SOME OF YOUR FAVORITE GRAPHIC DESIGN OR DEVELOPMENT RELATED WEBSITES.</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://bettywang.studio/" target="_blank">Betty Wang Studio</a></li>
        <p>Appreciate the minimalist design showcased on Betty Wang Studio, as it exemplifies simplicity and elegance in graphic design.</p>

        <li><a href="https://www.writtenshape.com/" target="_blank">WrittenShape</a></li>
        <p>Impressed by the interactive elements on WrittenShape, highlighting the importance of engaging user experiences in web design.</p>

    <h3>12. POETRY
        <pre>

        <!-- Add more artists as needed -->
    </ul>

    <h3>16. Difference Between Block, Inline-Block, and Inline Elements</h3>

    <p>Block elements, like divs and paragraphs, form distinct vertical blocks, starting on a new line and spanning the full width. Inline elements, such as spans and anchors, flow horizontally within the content. Inline-block elements combine both behaviors, flowing horizontally like inline elements while allowing block-level styling. This versatility makes them useful for creating components that align horizontally while maintaining block-level characteristics. The choice between block, inline, and inline-block depends on the desired layout structure and the interaction of elements within the design, influencing the overall appearance and responsiveness of web pages.</p>

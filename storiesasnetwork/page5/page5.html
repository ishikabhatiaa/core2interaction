        <p>You might say a poem is a semicolon, a living semicolon, what connects the first line to the last, the act of
            keeping together that whose nature is to fly apart. Between the first and last lines there exists—a poem—and
            if it were not for the poem that intervenes, the first and last lines of a poem would not speak to each
            other.

            Would not speak to each other. Because the lines of a poem are speaking to each other, not you to them or
            they to you.

            I will tell you what I miss: I miss watching a movie and at the end, huge scrolled words come on the screen
            and say: The End. I miss finishing a novel and there on the last page, at a discrete distance from the last
            words of the last sentence, are the dark letters spelling The End.

            It was its own thrill. I didn’t ignore them, I read them, even if only silently, with a deep sense of
            feeling: both the feeling of being replete, a feeling of satisfaction, and the feeling of loss, the sadness
            of having finished the book.

            I have never, in my life, read a poem that ended with the words The End. Why is that, I wonder. I think
            perhaps the brevity of poems compared to novels makes one feel that there has been no great sustention of
            energy, no marathon worthy of pulling tape across the finish line. And then I found a poem of mine that I
            had carefully written by hand in the sixth grade, and at the bottom of the page, in India ink, beautifully
            apart from the rest of the text, were the words The End. And I realized children very often denote the end
            because it is indeed a great achievement for them to have written anything, and they are completely unaware
            of the number of stories and poems that have already been written; they know some, of course, but have not
            yet found out the extent to which they are not the only persons residing on the planet. And so they sign
            their poems and stories like kings. Which is a wonderful thing.

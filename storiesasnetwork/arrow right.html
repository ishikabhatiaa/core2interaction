    <title>On Beginnings</title>

        <p>In life, the number of beginnings is exactly equal to the number of endings: no one has yet to begin a life who will not end it.<br> 
        In poetry, the number of beginnings so far exceeds the number of endings that we cannot even conceive of it. <br>Not every poem is finished—one poem is abandoned, another catches fire and is carried away by the wind, which may be an ending,<br> but it is the ending of a poem without an end. 
        Paul Valéry, the French poet and thinker, once said that no poem is ever ended, that every poem is merely abandoned. <br>This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, for where quotations begin is in a cloud. <br>
        Paul Valéry also described his perception of first lines so vividly, and to my mind so accurately, <br>that i have never forgotten it: the opening line of a poem, he said, is like finding a fruit on the ground, <br>a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen before, and the poet’s task is to create the tree from which such a fruit would fall. 
        <br>In the beginning was the Word. Western civilization rests upon those words.<br> And yet there is a lively group of thinkers who believe that in the beginning was the act that nothing can precede action<br>—no breath before act, no thought before act, no pervasive love before some kind of act.
